# CE888  Data Science and Decision Making Project

This is my University of Essex MSc. Artificial Intelligence, CE888-7-SP : Data Science and Decision Making, Under the guidance of Dr Ana Matran-Fernandez. 
Thank you so much Dr Ana Matran-Fernandez and team for all the support.
Hence, This project is  in-process and code is not accurate. I will update it on regualr basis to improve the code stability and accuracy. 
So, Please stay tuned, Thank you for your precious time that you have evaluated to see my project code.
